Module09_Challenge

This is the sql_challenge homework module.

I have included several files that represent initial attempts at creating the database schema in QuickDBD. I made several changes to relationships within the schema and needed several attempts to improve each. I have included these schema exports for your review. They are the quickDBD-export*.sql files. The quickDBD-export3.sql is the one that was used for the analysis.

I also included a png of the schema used.

I placed the sql query code in a separate file in the end to keep it separate from the dbd exports. The tasks are in the tasks.sql file.

Within the tasks file, I again frequently needed to try different approaches to try to get the output requested. I have labelled each as a 'trial'. I kept them so I could see what worked and what didn't as I progressed.
